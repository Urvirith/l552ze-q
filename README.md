# L552ZE-Q
STM32 M33 - Core - Being Used For 3D Printer Base, Due To Shield And PINOUTs

HAL Layer Code for the STM32L552ZE-Q Code

All testing of HAL layer will be done in the project with the intent of then creating a library 

The goal of this project is not to replace any other projects, however be simple enough to show others how to interface with the raw data registers, hardware layer thus creating a HAL without the need for any additional libraries

Documentation can be found here for the STM32L552ZE
